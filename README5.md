my Approach 
1.Sort the elements
2.Remove duplicate Elements
3.find the Largest sequence differ by 1
firstly take the input type array(int) name nums
at the end it returns integer value
It returns an integer, which is the length of the longest consecutive sequence.
If the input array has no elements (length == 0), we directly return 0 because there is no sequence possible.
then we have to Sort the array in ascending order.
we have to declare two variables maxlen and currentlen they both are int type and their value is 1
maxLen:Stores the length of the longest sequence found so far.
Initialized to 1 because any non-empty array has at least one element in a sequence.
currentLen:Tracks the length of the current consecutive sequence as we iterate through the array.
Also initialized to 1.
we have to declare i and j two int variables and their value should be 1 because we have to compare with the next element.
If the current element is equal to the previous one, we skip it because duplicates don‚Äôt affect the sequence length.
Example:
{1, 2, 2, 3} ‚Üí we treat 2 only once when calculating sequences.
If the difference between the current element and the previous element is exactly 1, it means they are consecutive numbers.
So, we increment currentLen by 1.
If the difference is not 1, we reset currentLen because the sequence has been disconnected.
We compare the current sequence length (currentLen) with the longest found so far (maxLen).
If currentLen is larger, we update maxLen to that value.
After going through the entire array, we return the longest sequence length found.

# üìÇ **Longest Consecutive Sequence**

## ‚úÖ **Problem Statement**

Given an integer array `nums`, find the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers. The sequence must have elements that differ by exactly 1, and duplicates should be ignored.

---

## ‚úÖ **Approach**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Sort the elements**

* The array is sorted in ascending order to bring consecutive elements next to each other.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Remove duplicate elements**

* While iterating, duplicates are skipped since they don't contribute to extending the sequence.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Find the largest sequence where elements differ by 1**

* By comparing each element with its previous element, we can check whether it is part of a consecutive sequence.

---

## ‚úÖ **Steps Explained**

1. **Input**

   * Take the input as an integer array named `nums`.
   * Example: `{1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2}`

2. **Return Type**

   * The function returns an integer value which is the length of the longest consecutive sequence.

3. **Handle Empty Array**

   * If the input array has no elements (`length == 0`), return `0` as no sequence is possible.

4. **Sorting**

   * Sort the array in ascending order using `Arrays.sort(nums)`.

5. **Declare Variables**

   ```java
   int maxLen = 1;
   int currentLen = 1;
   ```

   * **maxLen**

     * Stores the length of the longest sequence found so far.
     * Initialized to `1` because even a single element counts as a sequence.

   * **currentLen**

     * Tracks the length of the current consecutive sequence while iterating.
     * Also initialized to `1`.

6. **Iterate with Index Variables**

   ```java
   for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
   ```

   * Use `i` to loop through the array from the second element onwards to compare with the previous element.

7. **Skip Duplicates**

   ```java
   if (nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) {
       continue;
   }
   ```

   * If the current element is the same as the previous one, skip it to avoid counting duplicates.
   * Example: `{1, 2, 2, 3}` ‚Üí treat `2` only once.

8. **Check for Consecutive Elements**

   ```java
   if (nums[i] - nums[i - 1] == 1) {
       currentLen++;
   }
   ```

   * If the difference between the current and previous element is exactly `1`, it is part of a consecutive sequence, so increment `currentLen`.

9. **Reset When Sequence Breaks**

   ```java
   else {
       currentLen = 1;
   }
   ```

   * If the difference is not `1`, reset `currentLen` to `1`.

10. **Update Longest Sequence**

    ```java
    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, currentLen);
    ```

    * Compare `currentLen` with `maxLen` and update `maxLen` if `currentLen` is larger.

11. **Return the Result**

    ```java
    return maxLen;
    ```

    * After the loop ends, return the longest sequence length found.

---

## ‚úÖ **Example Run**

**Input:**

```java
int[] nums = {1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2};
```

**Output:**

```
Length of longest consecutive sequence is: 4
```

**Explanation:**
The longest sequence is `{1, 2, 3, 4}` ‚Üí length = 4.

---

## ‚úÖ **Conclusion**

* Sorting helps in grouping consecutive numbers.
* Duplicate elements are ignored while counting sequences.
* We use two variables (`maxLen` and `currentLen`) to efficiently track sequence lengths.
* This approach ensures we process the array in a simple and understandable way while producing accurate results.
