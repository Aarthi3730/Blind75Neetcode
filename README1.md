to find duplicate Number
if we there is duplicate numbers in the code then the output should be False 
else true
this is the approach
how to do?
first take a list then we have to add first element
then add next element if it is not similar to first element tehn we have to add that number to the list
if the number is same then we have to return false we have to check overall array
