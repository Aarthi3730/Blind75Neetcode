For the input {1, 2, 3, 4}, the output is [24, 12, 8, 6] that is 
At index 0 → product of [2, 3, 4] = 24
At index 1 → product of [1, 3, 4] = 12
At index 2 → product of [1, 2, 4] = 8
At index 3 → product of [1, 2, 3] = 6
to find the length of the array we have to declARE a variable n and its its type is array of int 
we have to declare a variable with name result and type array of int
we have to declare two another variables i and j type int nad their value is 0 initially
we have to take a variable name product and initialize type int and value 1
